Well, if he \\nwere a hero, he’d unmask himself \\nand tell us who he really is!  \\nBecause only a coward conceals his \\nidentity.  Only a coward hides his \\ntrue intentions!\\nEXT. DONUT SHOP - DAY\\nPeter walks down the street.  This time, no one recognizes \\nhim.  \\nJ. JONAH JAMESON (V.O.)\\nRest assured, ladies and gentlemen, \\nthis reporter will uncover those \\nintentions come hell or high water.  \\nPeter reads aloud to himself from a hand-written note:\\n                                                                176.\\n                                                                177.\\nPETER\\nHi, my name is Peter Parker.  You \\ndon’t know me, but I... uh.  Hi, my \\nname is Peter Parker, and you don’t \\nknow me, but you--\\nHe stops outside the donut shop.  Now with holiday \\ndecorations.  Christmas lights.  He enters...\\nINT. DONUT SHOP - CONTINUOUS (DAY)\\nPeter finds MJ, talking and laughing with an older customer, \\na STAN LEE LOOK-ALIKE.\\nMJ turns, looks up at him, and waves.  He’s taken aback... \\nUntil he realizes she was waving at Ned, who has just entered \\nbehind him.  \\nNED\\n(to MJ)\\nHey!\\nNed walks past Peter and sits at the counter.  \\nMJ\\n(to Ned)\\nOne sec.\\n(to Peter)\\nCan I help you?  \\nPETER\\nHi, um, My name is Peter Parker.  \\nAnd I... \\n(loses nerve)\\nWould like a coffee, please.  \\nMJ\\nOkay, no problem, Peter Parker.  \\nAs MJ goes for the coffee pot, she chats with Ned.  Hands \\nover a free donut.  \\nMJ (CONT'D)\\nDonut for my fellow engineer.  \\nNED\\nOh... Wait, what?\\nMJ\\nMIT, they’re the Engineers.  The \\nMascot.    \\n                                                                177.\\n                                                                178.\\nNED\\nOh, right, right, right.  I should \\nprobably know that.  \\n(then)\\nLook at you with the school spirit!\\nMJ\\nTell anybody, I will deny it.\\nNED\\nOh, right, right...\\nNed looks back at his phone, scrolling.\\nPeter smiles.  Happy to see them.  Thrilled that they got in.\\nMJ slides Peter his coffee.  ANGLE ON the cup: “We Are Happy \\nTo Serve You.” \\nMJ\\nPeter Parker.  \\n(no reply)\\n...Peter Parker?  \\nPeter breaks his concentration from Ned, turns to MJ.\\nMJ (CONT'D)\\nYour coffee.\\nPETER\\nRight.  Thank you.\\nMJ\\nMmm-hmm.\\nPETER\\nUm... are you excited for MIT?\\nMJ is confused at first.  But then she realizes -- he must \\nhave overheard her and Ned.\\nMJ\\nOh.  Uh, right, yeah.  Uh... \\n(then)\\nYeah, actually, I am excited which \\nis weird ‘cause I don’t really get \\nexcited about things.  I kind of \\nexpect disappointment-- \\nPETER\\n--’Cause then you’ll never actually \\nbe disappointed.  Right?\\nA flicker of déjà vu on her face, then, recovering: \\n                                                                178.\\n                                                                179.\\nMJ\\nUh, yeah.  Right.  It’s just, um-- \\nI dunno, it just kinda feels \\ndifferent this time for some \\nreason.   \\nThis gives him pause.  Her new life.\\nSomewhat dazed, Peter pays for the coffee.\\nPETER\\nUm, what I was-- \\nMJ brushes back her hair.  He sees a Band-Aid above her eye -- \\nher injury from the Statue of Liberty.\\nPETER (CONT'D)\\n(re: Band-Aid)\\nYou okay?\\nMJ\\nIt doesn’t really hurt anymore.   \\n(beat, then)\\nIs there anything else?  \\nPeter pauses.  The moment of truth... \\nBut he just shakes his head and smiles.\\nPETER\\nUh... no.\\nPeter tucks his note back into his pocket.\\nPETER (CONT'D)\\nThank you.\\nMJ\\nNo problem.\\nPeter takes his coffee, looks over at Ned, then back at MJ.\\nPETER\\nI’ll uh... see you around.\\nHe walks out the door.  \\nHOLD ON MJ, watching Peter go with a lingering sense of... \\nrecognition?\\n                                                                179.\\n                                                                180.\\nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY\\nA cold winter’s day.  Peter stands before May’s grave, sets \\ndown a flower.  Reveal the grave is covered in them, placed \\nin front of a tombstone that reads: “WHEN YOU HELP SOMEONE, \\nYOU HELP EVERYONE.”\\nA figure approaches -- Happy.  It’s clear he doesn’t \\nrecognize Peter.  \\nHAPPY\\nHow’d you know her?\\nPETER\\nThrough Spider-Man.  You?\\nHAPPY\\nSame.\\nThey stare at the grave for a beat.\\nHAPPY (CONT'D)\\nI lost a good friend a while back.  \\nFelt like this.\\n(then)\\nIt hurts ‘cause they’re gone.  And \\nthen it hurts all over again \\nbecause you remember what they \\nstood for, and you wonder, “Is all \\nthat gone too?”\\nA beat as that lands on Peter.\\nPETER\\nNo, it’s not gone.  Everyone that \\nshe helped... they’ll keep it \\ngoing.\\nHAPPY\\nYou really think so?\\nPETER\\nI know it.\\n(then)\\nTake care of yourself, okay?\\nHAPPY\\nYeah.  Nice to meet you.\\nPeter nods, then walks away, leaving Happy to pay his \\nrespects.\\n                                                                180.\\n                                                                181.\\nINT. PETER’S NEW APARTMENT - DAY\\nLANDLORD (O.S.)\\nRent is due on the first of the \\nmonth.  Don’t be late.  \\nPeter carries a box into a studio apartment.  Turns on the \\nlight, takes in the barren space.  His new home.  A fresh \\nstart.  \\nHe opens a box containing a GED test study manual, sets out \\nhis personal effects... including the LEGO Emperor figurine \\nfrom the Death Star set he and Ned built (and rebuilt) many \\ntimes together.\\nINT. PETER’S NEW APARTMENT - LATER (NIGHT)\\nPeter looks out the window.  Snow falling on New York.  He \\nturns to his Spider-Man mask on the bed, grabs it... \\nPeter follows a New York police precinct app on his phone.\\nPRECINCT VOICE #1 (OVER PHONE)\\n4-3 Edward, do you need EMS assist?\\nPRECINCT VOICE #2 (OVER PHONE)\\nUh, negative, Central.  We’re gonna \\nneed a car tow.\\nANGLE ON a desk with a sewing machine.  Scraps of red and \\nblue fabric.  Nearby rests the LEGO Emperor figurine and the \\ncoffee cup MJ gave Peter at the donut shop.  He kept it.  \\nIn BG, Spider-Man slides up the window and leaps outside...\\nEXT. NEW YORK ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)\\nSpider-Man flips and rolls across a snowy roof in a BLUE AND \\nRED SUIT (new for him, but reminiscent of suits he’s seen \\nbefore).  Spider-Man leaps and--\\nEXT. ROCKEFELLER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)\\n--Soars over the Rockefeller Christmas tree with a newfound \\nsense of freedom.  Liberated from having to juggle two lives.  \\nPeter Parker is no more, but Spider-Man lives on...\\nFADE OUT.\\nTHE END\\n                                                                181.\\n\"]"
